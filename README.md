## Projects
### 🤖 Movie Recommedation System
*Jan 2024 - Feb 2024*
- Developed a text-based movie recommendation system using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Scikit-learn’s TfidfVectorizer.
- Implemented a content-based filtering approach to recommend movies based on user’s preferred genre and desired rating.
- Utilized Streamlit, a Python library, to create an interactive and user-friendly web-based application for the
 recommendation system.

### 🤖 Breast Cancer Prediction Model
*Feb 2024*
- Machine Learning Model: Developed a predictive machine learning model using Python and scikit-learn to accurately diagnose breast cancer based on tumor characteristics and clinical data, achieving an AUC score of 0.87 on the validation set.
- Data Preprocessing: Performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques on a large breast cancer dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes for optimal model performance.
- Model Deployment: Integrated the trained model into a user-friendly web application using Flask, allowing healthcare professionals to input patient data and receive real-time predictions, along with interpretable
 explanations for the model’s output.



## Interests and Hobbies
In addition to my main work, I enjoy pursuing photography as a fun side activity.
